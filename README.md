Added more fields per user

V.1.3

Functional. Icons replaced with circles for 
other teams. Real time add and delete.


V.1.2

same as before except now it's wrapped with flask
and I hide my API keys in a config file. 
If you want to run this, get your own API key 
and remove the config import or make your own
config file

V.1.1

basically
team name 
location in x
location in y
click submit
you'll see it visualize beneath you
if you update the team name
you don't create a new team
yeah that's basically it
